## 1. Introduction

Facial recognition technology has become increasingly important in various applications including security systems, access control, and user authentication. The challenge of accurately identifying individuals from facial images involves several complex steps: face detection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. This work presents a comprehensive facial recognition system that addresses these challenges through a well-designed pipeline.

The primary contributions of this work include:
- A robust multi-stage facial recognition pipeline
- Integration of deep learning-based face detection with traditional machine learning
- Comprehensive evaluation methodology with proper train-test validation
- Practical implementation with both command-line and web interfaces
- Detailed analysis of system performance and limitations

## 2. Related Work

Facial recognition has evolved significantly from early geometric feature-based approaches to modern deep learning methods. Traditional approaches relied on handcrafted features such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), while contemporary methods leverage deep convolutional neural networks for end-to-end learning.

Recent advances in face recognition include ArcFace, which provides superior performance through angular margin loss, and InsightFace, which offers state-of-the-art face detection and recognition capabilities. Our work combines the strengths of modern face detection with traditional machine learning approaches for practical deployment scenarios.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Proper train-test validation prevents overfitting assessment
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Both command-line and web interfaces enhance usability
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures system stability

### 7.2 Limitations and Challenges

1. **Small Dataset**: Limited training data (50 samples) affects model generalization
2. **Class Imbalance**: Uneven distribution of samples per person impacts performance
3. **Feature Extraction Issues**: Traditional HOG-like features may not capture sufficient discriminative information
4. **Overfitting**: 100% training accuracy with 60% test accuracy indicates overfitting
5. **Limited Diversity**: Dataset lacks variation in lighting, pose, and expression

### 7.3 Performance Analysis

The significant gap between training (100%) and test (60%) accuracy indicates overfitting, likely caused by:
- Insufficient training data
- High model complexity relative to data size
- Limited feature discriminative power

The confusion matrix reveals that individuals with fewer training samples (pasindu: 3, ravishan: 7) perform poorly, while those with more samples (oshanda: 15) achieve perfect recognition.
